#### _Track the political contributions by company and create portfolio of tracked stocks, 4.13.17_

#### By _**Caitlin Hines, Katy Daviscourt, Kaz Matthews, and Nicole Sanders**_

## Description

_This application allows users to search for a company, view the company's political contributions and stock information, and add stocks to user's list of stocks to follow. View list of stocks in a user's portfolio, along with a pie chart breaking down the user's shares of each stock. Stocks can also be removed from portfolio._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone github repository: https://github.com/evergreencait/contributions.git_
* _Run npm install and bower install_
* _Run ng serve and navigate to localhost:4200_

## Known Bugs

_As of now, users cannot sign in. If we were to have more time, we would add authentication so that the application could keep track of the signed-in user across all pages and stocks could be added to the user's specific portfolio. Timeouts don't always allow enough time for all information to load. The APIs we selected don't contain all necessary information so companies that exist don't always show up as a result. We are missing error messages that handle no-response api calls._
